# Java Interfaces



## 1. Overview



In this tutorial, we're going to talk about interfaces in Java. We'll also see how Java uses them to implement polymorphism and multiple inheritances.



## 2. What Are Interfaces in Java?

In Java, an interface is an abstract type that contains a collection of methods and constant variables. It is one of the core concepts in Java and is **used to achieve abstraction, polymorphism and multiple inheritances**.

Let's see a simple example of an interface in Java:

```java
public interface Electronic {

    // Constant variable
    String LED = "LED";

    // Abstract method
    int getElectricityUse();

    // Static method
    static boolean isEnergyEfficient(String electtronicType) {
        if (electtronicType.equals(LED)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    //Default method
    default void printDescription() {
        System.out.println("Electronic Description");
    }
}

```

We can implement an interface in a Java class by using the *implements* keyword.

Next, let's also create a *Computer* class that implements the *Electronic* interface we just created:

```java
public class Computer implements Electronic {

    @Override
    public int getElectricityUse() {
        return 1000;
    }
}

```





### 2.1. Rules for Creating Interfaces

In an interface, we're allowed to use:

- [constants variables](https://www.baeldung.com/java-final)
- [abstract methods](https://www.baeldung.com/java-abstract-class)
- [static methods](https://www.baeldung.com/java-static-default-methods)
- [default methods](https://www.baeldung.com/java-static-default-methods)

We also should remember that:

- we can't instantiate interfaces directly
- an interface can be empty, with no methods or variables in it
- we can't use the *final* word in the interface definition, as it will result in a compiler error
- all interface declarations should have the *public* or default access modifier; the *abstract* modifier will be added automatically by the compiler
- an interface method can't be *protected* or *final*
- up until Java 9, interface methods could not be *private*; however, Java 9 introduced the possibility to define [private methods in interfaces](https://www.baeldung.com/java-interface-private-methods)
- interface variables are *public*, *static*, and *final* by definition; we're not allowed to change their visibility





## 3. What Can We Achieve by Using Them?



### 3.1. Behavioral Functionality

We use interfaces to add certain behavioral functionality that can be used by unrelated classes. For instance, *Comparable*, *Comparator*, and *Cloneable* are Java interfaces that can be implemented by unrelated classes. Below is an example of the *Comparator* interface that is used to compare two instances of the *Employee* class:

```java
public class Employee {

    private double salary;

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}

public class EmployeeSalaryComparator implements Comparator<Employee> {

    @Override
    public int compare(Employee employeeA, Employee employeeB) {
        if (employeeA.getSalary() < employeeB.getSalary()) {
            return -1;
        } else if (employeeA.getSalary() > employeeB.getSalary()) { 
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}

```

### 3.2. Multiple Inheritances

Java classes support singular inheritance. However, by using interfaces, we're also able to implement multiple inheritances.

For instance, in the example below, we notice that the *Car* class implements the *Fly* and *Transform* interfaces. By doing so, it inherits the methods *fly* and *transform*:

```java
public interface Transform {
    void transform();
}

public interface Fly {
    void fly();
}

public class Car implements Fly, Transform {

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("I can Fly!!");
    }

    @Override
    public void transform() {
        System.out.println("I can Transform!!");
    }
}

```



### 3.3. Polymorphism

Let's start with asking the question: what is [polymorphism](https://www.baeldung.com/java-polymorphism)? It's the ability for an object to take different forms during runtime. To be more specific it's the execution of the override method that is related to a specific object type at runtime.

**In Java, we can achieve polymorphism using interfaces.** For example, the *Shape* interface can take different forms â€” it can be a *Circle* or a *Square.*

Let's start by defining the *Shape* interface:

```java
public interface Shape {
    String name();
}

```

Now let's also create the *Circle* class:

```java
public class Circle implements Shape {

    @Override
    public String name() {
        return "Circle";
    }
}

```

And also the *Square* class:

```java
public class Square implements Shape {

    @Override
    public String name() {
        return "Square";
    }
}

```



Finally, it's time to see polymorphism in action using our *Shape* interface and its implementations. Let's instantiate some *Shape* objects, add them to a List,and, finally, print their names in a loop:

```java
List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<>();
Shape circleShape = new Circle();
Shape squareShape = new Square();

shapes.add(circleShape);
shapes.add(squareShape);

for (Shape shape : shapes) {
    System.out.println(shape.name());
}

```



## 4. Default Methods in Interfaces

Traditional interfaces in Java 7 and below don't offer backward compatibility.

What this means is that **if you have legacy code written in Java 7 or earlier, and you decide to add an abstract method to an existing interface, then all the classes that implement that interface must override the new abstract method**. Otherwise, the code will break.

**Java 8 solved this problem by introducing the default method** that is optional and can be implemented at the interface level.





## 5. Interface Inheritance Rules

In order to achieve multiple inheritances thru interfaces, we have to remember a few rules. Let's go over these in detail.



### 5.1. Interface Extending Another Interface

When an interface *extends* another interface, it inherits all of that interface's abstract methods. Let's start by creating two interfaces, *HasColor* and *Shape*:

```java
public interface HasColor {
    String getColor();
}

public interface Box extends HasColor {
    int getHeight()
}

```

In the example above, *Box* inherits from *HasColor* using the keyword *extends.* By doing so, the *Box* interface inherits *getColor*. As a result, the *Box* interface now has two methods: *getColor* and *getHeight*.



### 5.2. Abstract Class Implementing an Interface

When an abstract class implements an interface, it inherits all of its abstract and default methods. Let's consider the *Transform* interface and the *abstract* class *Vehicle* that implements it:

```java
public interface Transform {
    
    void transform();
    default void printSpecs(){
        System.out.println("Transform Specification");
    }
}

public abstract class Vehicle implements Transform {}

```

In this example, the *Vehicle* class inherits two methods: the abstract *transform* method and the default *printSpecs* method.



## 6. Functional Interfaces

Java has had many functional interfaces since its early days, such as *Comparable* (since Java 1.2) and *Runnable* (since Java 1.0).

Java 8 introduced new functional interfaces such as *Predicate*, *Consumer*, and *Function*. To learn more about these, please visit our tutorial on [Functional Interfaces in Java 8](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-functional-interfaces).
